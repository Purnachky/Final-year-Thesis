**Parkinson's Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms**

The main aim of this evaluation became identifying existing ML-based research frequently, diagnosing PD in terms of handwritten patterns, voice attributes, and gait dataset and deciding the maximum suitable technique to diagnose PD properly. The dataset which contains 22(excluding the "status" column) voice attributes of 195 samples, I found the most appropriate ML process, KNN as a simple recognized classifier with a high accuracy-97% to detect normal patients who may be affected by this disease.
